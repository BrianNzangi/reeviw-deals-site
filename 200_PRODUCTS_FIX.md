# Fixed: Homepage Now Shows 200 Products

## ✅ **Problem Resolved**
The homepage was only showing 20 products instead of the requested 200 products.

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Updated Homepage Initial Load**
- **File**: `app/(routes)/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Increased `.limit(20)` to `.limit(200)`
- **Result**: Homepage now loads 200 products immediately

### 2. **Enhanced InfiniteProductGrid Component**
- **File**: `components/products/InfiniteProductGrid.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - ✅ Smart page calculation: `Math.ceil(initialProducts.length / 20) + 1`
  - ✅ Proper hasMore logic based on initial products length
  - ✅ Total products tracking from API response
  - ✅ Accurate end message: "Showing all 283 products"

## 📊 **Test Results**

```
📦 Total products in database: 283
✅ Successfully loaded 200 products
📊 Pagination Info:
   - Loaded: 200 products
   - Remaining: 83 products
   - Has more: Yes
   - Next page would be: 11
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

1. **Initial Load**: Homepage immediately shows 200 products
2. **Infinite Scroll**: If user scrolls to bottom, loads remaining 83 products
3. **Smart Pagination**: Starts from page 11 (since 200÷20 = 10 pages already loaded)
4. **Accurate Messaging**: Shows "You've reached the end! Showing all 283 products"

## 🚀 **User Experience**

### Before
- ❌ Only 20 products visible
- ❌ Message said "Showing all 20 products"

### After  
- ✅ 200 products visible immediately
- ✅ Remaining 83 products load on scroll
- ✅ Accurate message: "Showing all 283 products"

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit homepage: http://localhost:3000

3. Expected behavior:
   - ✅ See 200 products immediately
   - ✅ Scroll to load remaining 83 products
   - ✅ Final message: "You've reached the end! 🎉 Showing all 283 products"

Your homepage now correctly shows 200 products initially with infinite scroll for the remaining products! 🎉
